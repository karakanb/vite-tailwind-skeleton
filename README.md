# DO NOT USE THIS
I have built this skeleton some time ago to scratch my own itch, and moved on from it on a per-project basis as versions have changed. I don't maintain this, and I don't intend to make any changes to it; therefore, please refer to the corresponding tools' docs to set them up on your own.
